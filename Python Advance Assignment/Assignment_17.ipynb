    "#### Q1. Explain the difference between greedy and non-greedy syntax with visual terms in as few words as possible. What is the bare minimum effort required to transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one? What characters or characters can you introduce or change?\n",

The Non Greedy Match will try to match as few repetitions of the quantified pattern as possible. If only Non Greedy Match is available, we can use other filtering or pattern matching methods of regex and further identify the required pattern."
